Change directory to this one and type ./run . Simple as that :)


Working: Variable declarations, control statements, function and procedure declarations 
and calls , all expressions,arrays and pointers , etc...


Not working: Else if ("if" and "else" work) , typecasts  typedefs and function pointers. 
Also, readInteger() due to compilation errors :( Change the file manually in fl.

Enjoy!
